# Scraper

A simple sub 70 line piece of code to scrape a webiste and store the data locally in a DB.

Patch 2 will look to include some form of conditional which checks the db to see if any pre-existing rows exits identical to thast which is to be placed in the insert statement and if it does then it will not add the aformentioned row of data

The script is set locally on my machine to run every 2 days as per a cron job
